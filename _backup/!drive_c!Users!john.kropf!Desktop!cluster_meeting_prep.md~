* Overview of goals

1. Determine similarity of 3 digit zip areas along 3 different axes of similarity

    1. Drayage Miles
    2. Empty Miles
    3. Freight Balance
    4. Freight Volume

1. Intial Steps:

    1. Gather Data
    1. 







    1. Determine a framework:
 
      1. Partitioning or Hirerachrical
 
         1. constuct random partitions and refine them algorithmically (k-means)
 
             1. Not good for oddly shaped clusters; not good for 
             1. Good for contiguious clusters
             1. Badly suited to noisy data

          1. 

    
       1. 3 major geographical clustering methods:

          1. KMeans: Decide number of clusters and algorithmically determine what nodes belong to what group
          1. AGNES: Agglomerative Clustering
          1. DIANA: Divisive Clustering 
          1. 




       1. Collected Dray Data a Varietyof ways, ran the analysis, and found untrustworthy results

       1. TODO: Examine how to add in other dimensions

          1. Dimesions must be scaled --OR-- we must run a Princomp on all data to determine 
          1. 

    1. Examine various methods for determing similarity
