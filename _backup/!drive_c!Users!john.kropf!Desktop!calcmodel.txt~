 _ computed repo classification:
   _ if market is less than 50 loads/yr and majority of repos are in, repo in
   _ if market is less than 50 loads/yr and majority of repos are out, repo out
   _ if market is greater than 50 loads/yr and 5









=
IF(I2>50,
  IF(O2<-0.05,"OB",
    IF(O2>0.05,"IB","NA")),
  IF(N2<-2,"OB",
    IF(N2>2,"IB","NA")))


As discussed previously:

   market that is more than 1/wk, if 5% of loads
   in/out require a repo, classified as a repo market in that
   direction

      costs of repo determined from Brendan's file of likely repo
      costs, this column is marked average, b/c it averages repos
      from all origins in and all destinations out. These are not
      volume weighted, but they could be.

            rationale at the time was that repo was next best
            alternative, so the costs to fence the loser should take
            most likely repo into account
            
    calc'd repo costs were applied based on o/d market classification

    origin markets classified as IB repo markets were fenced with that
    cost

    dest markets classified as OB repo markets were fenced with that
    cost

    fence was applied to both the loser that had the 3 leg fence
    applied and to the original calc'd value

    Disagree column marks where they aren't the same

 where to go from here?
